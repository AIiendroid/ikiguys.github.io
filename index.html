            After spending ten days filled with surf, winds, sands and tasty breakfasts with beautiful people in Chicama, we decided it was time to pack our tent and backpacks and keep on moving towards north. North meant warmer sea waters and more tropical weather conditions; and that attracted us...<br>

            Ever since we thought of visiting Peru's coast, Chicama was always on the top of our to-go places mainly due to the legendary status of <em>longest left waves in the world</em>. And that's where we headed next...

            Huanchaco is a sleepy city with a frozen time that spreads through the streets with a fog. Our first point on the map after Lima: the city is squeezed between the ocean and the desert, three or four big streets, the highest building &dash; church on a hill...

            For us, Lima was a dusty horizon, described mostly by outdated guides from 2017. They all, like many of our friends who are hardened mountain tourist now, advised us to avoid Lima. However, some sincerely admired the huge city and told us where to stay and what to see. Now, after spending 3 unforgettable days in Lima, we tell you what our eyes saw, ears heard and why smiles bloomed on our faces. Let's go! ... <br>

            Our morning started like any other, waking up at 5:30, washing, stretching and meditating, but this time we would be closing the doors of our little house behind us for the last time. Instead of renewing our rent, we decided that we could use that money and the time we had to already jump into unknown adventures with our backpacks... <a class="readmore" href="/archive/2022/of-a-long-road-from-mountains-to-desert-coast/">Read More</a>

            Kinsa Cocha (kimsaqucha) &dash; three tears of divine inspiration. Kinsa Kocha is a mountain range with three lakes splashing in its embrace at an altitude of over 4,000 meters. In this place it seems that if you turn your head, you will not find your own shadow. Here all thought dissolves and your whole being becomes the eyes of God, who came down to check his own quiet corner... <a class="readmore" href="/archive/2022/kinsa-cocha-unknown-planet/">Read More</a>

            The week before our travel was full of events and time flowed with the speed of a mountain river: we decided to leave Pisac for a while and explore the coast of Peru, where the ocean whispers to the desert under a red sun.  Sunday is marked with a red flag on the calendar &dash; this is the day we will begin our descent from the mountains to the Pacific coast and find ourselves in a completely different world. Today, however, is Friday, which we decide to use to visit a waterfall in Lamay, a tiny town near Pisac... <a class="readmore" href="/archive/2022/to-the-waterfalls-of-lamay/">Read More</a>

            Whoever arrives and hangs about the Pisac region usually have their attention drawn to the massive mountain formations that watches over the town, and even from below it is possible to see small pieces of what was once a settlement, nowadays in ruins, as well as the terraces which from afar looked like steps no higher than a metre... <a class="readmore" href="/archive/2022/of-ups-and-downs/">Read More</a>

            The evening before the hike was whispering with totally different plans. We were about to meet some of our friends and climb to the ruins from the side of the small river, that could hide our steps from the security guys - tickets for tourists are crazy expensive! But morning probably didn't like the taste of our sweet story and spat out all our plans, sending us to the best freestyle journey... <a class="readmore" href="/archive/2022/the-lord-of-the-dance/">Read More</a>
