            The longer we stayed in the biggest city of Amazonas - Manaus, the more we felt like we needed to keep on moving. We definitely enjoyed our stay, spending time with our great friend and host Marx, visiting the city and so on. We ended up staying longer than expected mostly due to the three of us catching Chikungunya, a virus spread by infected mosquitoes that leaves you with headaches, fever, joint pain and feeling weak in general. After four days recovering, we were ready to go back to the boat life and continue our journey up the Amazon river...<br>

            Manaus is like a bubble, huge bubble that hide the whole world inside. It is hot, noisy and bright independent organism in the middle of wild rain forest. Everything is moving inside: huge clouds that never rain, hot humid air, millions of people and even more cars...<br>

            If the plans are burning, you better turn your head to the fire and get its energy. Then go to the ocean, let the waves clean your mind and the wind make the inner strings tense again. That’s how one morning we decided to go on the journey to the Amazon’s heart. Our idea was to get a pretty cheap flight to Iquitos, and from there take a boat to the Peruvian-Brazilian border (Santa Rosa in Peru and Tabatinga in Brazil) and then &mdash; to Manaus...<br>

            After spending ten days filled with surf, winds, sands and tasty breakfasts with beautiful people in Chicama, we decided it was time to pack our tent and backpacks and keep on moving towards north. North meant warmer sea waters and more tropical weather conditions; and that attracted us...<br>

            Huanchaco is a sleepy city with a frozen time that spreads through the streets with a fog. Our first point on the map after Lima: the city is squeezed between the ocean and the desert, three or four big streets, the highest building &dash; church on a hill...

            For us, Lima was a dusty horizon, described mostly by outdated guides from 2017. They all, like many of our friends who are hardened mountain tourist now, advised us to avoid Lima. However, some sincerely admired the huge city and told us where to stay and what to see. Now, after spending 3 unforgettable days in Lima, we tell you what our eyes saw, ears heard and why smiles bloomed on our faces. Let's go! ... <br>

            Kinsa Cocha (kimsaqucha) &dash; three tears of divine inspiration. Kinsa Kocha is a mountain range with three lakes splashing in its embrace at an altitude of over 4,000 meters. In this place it seems that if you turn your head, you will not find your own shadow.

            The week before our travel was full of events and time flowed with the speed of a mountain river: we decided to leave Pisac for a while and explore the coast of Peru, where the ocean whispers to the desert under a red sun.  Sunday is marked with a red flag on the calendar &dash; this is the day we will begin our descent from the mountains to the Pacific coast and find ourselves in a completely different world. Today, however, is Friday, which we decide to use to visit a waterfall in Lamay, a tiny town near Pisac... <a class="readmore" href="/archive/2022/to-the-waterfalls-of-lamay/">Read More</a>

            Whoever arrives and hangs about the Pisac region usually have their attention drawn to the massive mountain formations that watches over the town, and even from below it is possible to see small pieces of what was once a settlement, nowadays in ruins, as well as the terraces which from afar looked like steps no higher than a metre... <a class="readmore" href="/archive/2022/of-ups-and-downs/">Read More</a>
