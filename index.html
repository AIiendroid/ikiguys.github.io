            Whoever arrives and hangs about the Pisac region usually have their attention drawn to the massive mountain formations that watches over the town, and even from below it is possible to see small pieces of what was once a settlement, nowadays in ruins, as well as the terraces which from afar looked like steps no higher than a metre... <a class="readmore" href="/archive/2022/of-ups-and-downs/">Read More</a>

            The evening before the hike was whispering with totally different plans. We were about to meet some of our friends and climb to the ruins from the side of the small river, that could hide our steps from the security guys - tickets for tourists are crazy expensive! But morning probably didn't like the taste of our sweet story and spat out all our plans, sending us to the best freestyle journey... <a class="readmore" href="/archive/2022/the-lord-of-the-dance/">Read More</a>

            Silence melts under the sun. Above 4,000 metres time does not exist. The moment is so full of existence and variety floating into your eyes that there is no room for thoughts in your head...

            As our eyes opened this morning, the view outside of the window was the usual breathtaking layering of mountains but this time with a light blue coloured sky serving as the background. The first words uttered then, before any <em>good morning</em>, were "Let’s go for a hike"...

            After 11 hours inside an airplane, crossing the Atlantic and a good portion of South America, I landed in a very foggy early morning Lima but despite the fog, it was already possible to see shapes of mountains around the city. After passing by border and health control, I was already boarding my last flight, destination Cusco...

A typical Tuesday, I would normally say, but this one was no ordinary Tuesday...

            O universe, give us strength, give us love, give us faith in ourselves and in the people around us. For is there any concept of cosmic care if there is no purposeful, intentional evil? All that remains is unconditional love and continuous movement, the movement of form and matter, which by nature has no teeth-vectors, but simply happens. It just happens...
